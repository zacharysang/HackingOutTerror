# HackingOutTerror
Codebase for Hacking Out Terror Programming Competition (December 2016)

This project was intended a chrome extension that would allow a user to chat with other users on the same website at the same time. But is unfortunately largely incomplete. The main takeaway from this project was learning a lot about Chrome and Web extensions. This was the first time building an extension so I learned a lot about their layout and structure.
